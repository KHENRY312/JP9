Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen
eggs or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program that prompts a
user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation.
 For example, the typical output might be, You ordered 27 eggs. Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen
 and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85. Save the program as Eggs.java.
