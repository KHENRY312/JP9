 * Create a constructor for the Student class you created. The constructor should initialize each
 * Studentâ€™s ID numbers to 9999, his or her points earned to 12, and credit hours to 3 (resulting in
 * a grade point average of 4.0). Write a program that demonstrates that the constructor works by
 * instantiating an object and displaying the initial values. Save the application as
 * ShowStudent2.java.
