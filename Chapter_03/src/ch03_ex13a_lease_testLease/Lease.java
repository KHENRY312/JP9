 * Create a class named Lease with fields that hold an apartment tenantâ€™s name, apartment
 * number, monthly rent amount, and term of the lease in months. Include a constructor
 * that initializes the name to XXX, the apartment number to 0, the rent to 1000, and
 * the term to 12. Also include methods to get and set each of the fields. Include a
 * nonstatic method named addPetFee() that adds $10 to the monthly rent value and calls
 * a static method named explainPetPolicy() that explains the pet fee. Save the class as
 * Lease.java.
