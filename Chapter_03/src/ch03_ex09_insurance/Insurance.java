 * The Harrison Group Life Insurance company computes annual policy premiums based on the age the
 * customer turns in the current calendar year. The premium is computed by taking the decade of the
 * customerâ€™s age, adding 15 to it, and multiplying by 20. For example, a 34-year-old would pay $360,
 * which is calculated by adding the decades (3) to 15, and then multiplying by 20. Write an application
 * that prompts a user for the current year and a birth year. Pass both to a method that calculates and
 * returns the premium amount, and then display the returned amount. Save the application as
 * Insurance.java.
